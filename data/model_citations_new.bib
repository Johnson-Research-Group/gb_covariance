	abstract = {We present a modified embedded atom method (MEAM) semi-empirical force-field model for the Ti1-xAlxN (0 <= x <= 1) alloy system. The MEAM parameters, determined via an adaptive simulated-annealing (ASA) minimization scheme, optimize the model's predictions with respect to 0 K equilibrium volumes, elastic constants, cohesive energies, enthalpies of mixing, and point-defect formation energies, for a set of ~40 elemental, binary, and ternary Ti-Al-N structures and configurations. Subsequently, the reliability of the model is thoroughly verified against known finite-temperature thermodynamic and kinetic properties of key binary Ti-N and Al-N phases, as well as properties of Ti1-xAlxN (0 < x < 1) alloys. The successful outcome of the validation underscores the transferability of our model, opening the way for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of, e.g., phase evolution, interfacial processes, and mechanical response in Ti-Al-N-based alloys, superlattices, and nanostructures.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:820335782779:000a,
	abstract = {A set of embedded atom model (EAM) interatomic potentials was developed to represent highly idealized face-centered cubic (FCC) mixtures of Fe--Ni--Cr--Co--Al at near-equiatomic compositions. Potential functions for the transition metals and their crossed interactions are taken from our previous work for Fe--Ni--Cr--Co--Cu [D. Farkas and A. Caro: J. Mater. Res. 33 (19), 3218--3225, 2018], while cross-pair interactions involving Al were developed using a mix of the component pair functions fitted to known intermetallic properties. The resulting heats of mixing of all binary equiatomic random FCC mixtures not containing Al is low, but significant short-range ordering appears in those containing Al, driven by a large atomic size difference. The potentials are utilized to predict the relative stability of FCC quinary mixtures, as well as ordered L12 and B2 phases as a function of Al content. These predictions are in qualitative agreement with experiments. This interatomic potential set is developed to resemble but not model precisely the properties of this complex system, aiming at providing a tool to explore the consequences of the addition of a large size-misfit component into a high entropy mixture that develops multiphase microstructures.},

The MD simulation showed a layer-by-layer solid--liquid interface (SLI) motion mechanism in the [001] direction. The SLI migration seems to be satisfactorily described by Wilson--Frenkel theory in the temperature interval from 0.7Tm to Tm. It was found that the SLI passes an atomic plane as soon as the Sm sublattice is formed while the Al sublattice keeps forming for a while after that, and high Al diffusivity is observed in the solid phase. Those unsettled Al atoms trapped in solid phase will leave vacancies and form defects.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:992900971352:000a,
	abstract = {Kinking is a deformation mechanism ubiquitous to layered systems, ranging from the nanometer scale in layered crystalline solids, to the kilometer scale in geological formations. Herein, we demonstrate its origins in the former through multiscale experiments and atomistic simulations. When compressively loaded parallel to their basal planes, layered crystalline solids first buckle elastically, then nucleate atomic-scale, highly stressed ripplocation boundaries – a process driven by redistributing strain from energetically expensive in-plane bonds to cheaper out-of-plane bonds. The consequences are far reaching as the unique mechanical properties of layered crystalline solids are highly dependent upon their ability to deform by kinking. Moreover, the compressive strength of numerous natural and engineered layered systems depends upon the ease of kinking or lack there of.},

	abstract = {Second nearest neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN-MEAM) interatomic potentials are developed for binary aluminum (Al) alloys applicable from room temperature to the melting point. The binary alloys studied in this work are Al-Cu, Al-Fe and Al-Ni. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed on potential parameters based on the perturbation approach. The outcome of the sensitivity analysis shows that some of the MEAM parameters interdependently influence all MEAM model outputs, allowing for the definition of an ordered calibration procedure to target specific MEAM outputs. Using these 2NN-MEAM interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to calculate low and high-temperature properties, such as the formation energies of stable phases and unstable intermetallics, lattice parameters, elastic constants, thermal expansion coefficients, enthalpy of formation of solids, liquid mixing enthalpy, and liquidus temperatures at a wide range of compositions. The computed data are compared with the available first principle calculations and experimental data, showing high accuracy of the 2NN-MEAM interatomic potentials. In addition, the liquidus temperature of the Al binary alloys is compared to the phase diagrams determined by the CALPHAD method.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:803527979660:000a,
	abstract = {A set of embedded atom method model interatomic potentials is presented to represent a high-entropy alloy with five components. The set is developed to resemble but not model precisely face-centered cubic (fcc) near-equiatomic mixtures of Fe--Ni--Cr--Co--Cu. The individual components have atomic sizes deviating up to 3{\%}. With the heats of mixing of all binary equiatomic random fcc mixtures being less than 0.7 kJ/mol and the corresponding value for the quinary being −0.0002 kJ/mol, the potentials predict the random equiatomic fcc quinary mixture to be stable with respect to phase separation or ordering and with respect to bcc and hcp random mixtures. The details of lattice distortion, strain, and stress states in this phase are reported. The standard deviation in the individual nearest neighbor bond lengths was found to be in the range of 2{\%}. Most importantly, individual atoms in the alloy were found to be under atomic strains up to 0.5{\%}, corresponding to individual atomic stresses up to several GPa.},

	abstract = {We present an embedded atom method (EAM) potential for the binary Cu–Au system. The unary phases are described by two well-tested unary EAM potentials for Cu and Au. We fitted the interaction between Cu and Au to experimental properties of the binary intermetallic phases Cu3Au, CuAu and CuAu3. Particular attention has been paid to reproducing stacking fault energies in order to obtain a potential suitable for studying deformation in this binary system. The resulting energies, lattice constant, elastic properties and melting points are in good agreement with available experimental data. We use nested sampling to show that our potential reproduces the phase boundaries between intermetallic phases and the disordered face-centered cubic solid solution. We benchmark our potential against four popular Cu–Au EAM parameterizations and density-functional theory calculations.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:044341472608:000a,
	abstract = {Understanding the formation of the Earth’s inner core is essential to understanding the geodynamo and Earth's history. However, recent attempts to explain the initial solidification of the inner core have been unsuccessful. The supercooling necessary to form hcp iron is unrealistically large and creates the “inner core nucleation paradox.” Our work demonstrates that molten iron can crystallize via a two-step nucleation process involving the intermediate bcc phase under core conditions. This mechanism significantly reduces the required undercooling necessary to nucleate solid iron. This work also suggests that bcc and hcp iron have similar free energies at pressures near the inner core center. The Earth's inner core started forming when molten iron cooled below the melting point. However, the nucleation mechanism, which is a necessary step of crystallization, has not been well understood. Recent studies have found that it requires an unrealistic degree of undercooling to nucleate the stable, hexagonal, close-packed (hcp) phase of iron that is unlikely to be reached under core conditions and age. This contradiction is referred to as the inner core nucleation paradox. Using a persistent embryo method and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the metastable, body-centered, cubic (bcc) phase of iron has a much higher nucleation rate than does the hcp phase under inner core conditions. Thus, the bcc nucleation is likely to be the first step of inner core formation, instead of direct nucleation of the hcp phase. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron nucleation, which provides a key factor in solving the inner core nucleation paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens an avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner core.},

	abstract = {The predictive power of a classical molecular dynamics simulation is largely determined by the physical validity of its underlying empirical potential. In the case of high-energy collision cascades, it was recently shown that correctly modeling interactions at short distances is necessary to accurately predict primary damage production. An ab initio based framework is introduced for modifying an existing embedded-atom method FeNiCr potential to handle these short-range interactions. Density functional theory is used to calculate the energetics of two atoms approaching each other, embedded in the alloy, and to calculate the equation of state of the alloy as it is compressed. The pairwise terms and the embedding terms of the potential are modified in accordance with the ab initio results. Using this reparametrized potential, collision cascades are performed in Ni50Fe50, Ni80Cr20 and Ni33Fe33Cr33. The simulations reveal that alloying Ni and NiCr to Fe reduces primary damage production, in agreement with some previous calculations. Alloying Ni and NiFe to Cr does not reduce primary damage production, in contradiction with previous calculations.},

The potential predicts binding energies of various small oxygen-vacancy clusters in $\alpha$-iron in good agreement with density functional theory results, and is therefore suitable for simulations of oxygen-based defects in iron. We apply the potential in simulations of the stability and structure of Fe/FeO interfaces and FeO precipitates in iron, and observe that the shape of FeO precipitates can change due to formation of well-defined Fe/FeO interfaces. The interface with crystalline Fe also ensures that the precipitates never become fully amorphous, no matter how small they are.},

	abstract = {Fe-Ni-Cr stainless-steels are important structural materials because of their superior strength and corrosion resistance. Atomistic studies of mechanical properties of stainless-steels, however, have been limited by the lack of high-fidelity interatomic potentials. Here using density functional theory as a guide, we have developed a new Fe-Ni-Cr embedded atom method potential. We demonstrate that our potential enables stable molecular dynamics simulations of stainless-steel alloys at high temperatures, accurately reproduces the stacking fault energy—known to strongly influence the mode of plastic deformation (e.g., twinning vs. dislocation glide vs. cross-slip)—of these alloys over a range of compositions, and gives reasonable elastic constants, energies, and volumes for various compositions. The latter are pertinent for determining short-range order and solute strengthening effects. Our results suggest that our potential is suitable for studying mechanical properties of austenitic and ferritic stainless-steels which have vast implementation in the scientific and industrial communities.

	abstract = {We have constructed a set of embedded atom method (EAM) potentials for Fe, Ta, W and V and used them in order to study point defect properties. The parametrizations of the potentials ensure that the third order elastic constants are continuous and they have been fitted to the cohesive energies, the lattice constants, the unrelaxed vacancy formation energies and the second order elastic constants. Formation energies for different self-interstitials reveal that the 〈110〉 split dumbbell is the most stable configuration for Fe while for Ta, W and V we find that the 〈111〉 split dumbbell is preferred. Self-interstitial migration energies are simulated using the nudged elastic band method and for Fe and W the migration energies are found to be in good agreement with experimental and ab initio data. Migration energies for Ta and V self-interstitials are found to be quite low. The calculated formation, activation and migration energies for monovacancies are in good agreement with experimental data. Formation energies for divacancies reveal that the second nearest neighbor divacancy is more energetically favorable than nearest neighbor divacancies and the migration energies indicate that nearest neighbor migration paths are more likely to occur than second nearest neighbor migration jumps. For Fe, we have also studied the influence of the pair potential behavior between the second and third nearest neighbor on the stability of the 〈110〉 split dumbbell, which revealed that the higher the energy level of the pair potential is in that region, the more stable the 〈110〉 split dumbbell becomes.},

	abstract = {A semi-empirical atomic potential, the second nearest-neighbor MEAM, has been applied to obtain an atomic potential for the Fe-Cr system, based on the previously developed potentials for pure Fe and Cr. The procedure for the determination of potential parameter values and the performance of the assessed alloy potential were also presented. It was shown that the potential describes the basic thermodynamic property and alloy behavior in the bcc solid solution successfully, as well as many physical properties of pure Fe and Cr. The limit in the applicability of the present potential is also discussed.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:222110751402:000a,
	abstract = {An Ag–Ni semi-empirical potential was developed to simulate the segregation of Ni solutes at Ag grain boundaries (GBs). The potential combines a new Ag potential fitted to correctly reproduce the stable and unstable stacking fault energies in this metal and the existing Ni potential from Mendelev et al (2012 Phil. Mag. 92 4454–69). The Ag–Ni cross potential functions were fitted to ab initio data on the liquid structure of the Ag80Ni20 alloy to properly incorporate the Ag–Ni interaction at small atomic separations, and to the Ni segregation energies at different sites within a high-energy $\Sigma$9 (221) symmetric tilt GB. By deploying this potential with hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations, it was found that heterogeneous segregation and clustering of Ni atoms at GBs and twin boundary defects occur at low Ni concentrations, 1 and 2 at\%. This behavior is profoundly different from the homogeneous interfacial dispersion generally observed for the Cu segregation in Ag. A GB transformation to amorphous intergranular films was found to prevail at higher Ni concentrations (10 at\%). The developed potential opens new opportunities for studying the selective segregation behavior of Ni solutes in interface-hardened Ag metals and its effect on plasticity.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:103383163946:000a,
	abstract = { Primary radiation damage formation in solid materials typically involves collisions between atoms that have up to a few hundred keV of kinetic energy. During these collisions, the distance between two colliding atoms can approach 0.05 nm. At such small atomic separations, force fields fitted to equilibrium properties tend to significantly underestimate the potential energy of the colliding dimer. To enable molecular dynamics simulations of high-energy collisions, it is common practice to use a screened Coulomb force field to describe the interactions and to smoothly join this to the equilibrium force field at a suitable interatomic spacing. However, there is no accepted standard method for choosing the parameters used in the joining process, and our results prove that defect production is sensitive to how the force fields are linked. A new procedure is presented that involves the use of ab initio calculations to determine the magnitude and spatial dependence of the pair interactions at intermediate distances, along with systematic criteria for choosing the joining parameters. Results are presented for the case of nickel, which demonstrate the use and validity of the procedure. },

Then, the element segregation characteristics and thermal stability of Ni--Pd bimetallic nanoparticles were investigated by Monte Carlo method and molecular dynamics method. The results show that the chemical ordering pattern of PdxNi1−x nanoparticle is the result of the competition of surface energy, strain energy, bond energy and interface energy. When a small amount of Pd atoms are substitutionally doped into the Ni nanoparticle, all the Pd atoms will be segregated on the surface and dispersed. The synergistic effect of Ni atoms and Pd atoms in the surface will improve the catalytic activity and carbon deposition resistance of PdxNi1−x nanoparticle catalyst in methane dry reforming reaction. Increasing the doping amount of Pd atoms will gradually reduce the melting point of PdxNi1−x nanoparticle, thereby reducing its sintering resistance.},

Then, the element segregation characteristics and thermal stability of Ni–Rh nanoparticles were studied by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics. The results show that the chemical ordering pattern of Ni1-xRhx nanoparticles is the result of the competition of surface energy, strain energy, interface energy and bond energy. With the increase of x, Rh atoms are preferentially segregated to the surface and dispersed. The concentration of Rh atoms in the surface decreases with the increase of size or temperature. With the increase of x, the melting point of Ni1-xRhx nanoparticle first gradually increased, reached the highest near x ​= ​0.1, then gradually decreased, reached the lowest near x ​= ​0.5, and then gradually increased. The above results theoretically explain the reason why doping a small amount of Rh can improve the coking-resistance and sintering-resistance ability of Ni catalyst.},

	abstractnote = {Alloying of Ni with Fe or Co reduces primary damage production under ion irradiation. Similar results have been obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulations of 1, 10, 20, and 40 keV collision cascades in Ni, NiFe, and NiCo. In all cases, a mix of imperfect stacking fault tetrahedra, faulted loops with a 1/3 $\langle 111\rangle$ Burgers vector, and glissile interstitial loops with a 1/2 $\langle 110\rangle$ Burgers vector were formed, along with small sessile point defect complexes and clusters. Primary damage reduction occurs by three mechanisms. First, Ni-Co, Ni-Fe, Co-Co, and Fe-Fe short-distance repulsive interactions are stiffer than Ni-Ni interactions, which lead to a decrease in damage formation during the transition from the supersonic ballistic regime to the sonic regime. This largely controls final defect production. Second, alloying decreases thermal conductivity, leading to a longer thermal spike lifetime. The associated annealing reduces final damage production. These two mechanisms are especially important at cascades energies less than 40 keV. Third, at the higher energies, the production of large defect clusters by subcascades is inhibited in the alloys. A number of challenges and limitations pertaining to predictive atomistic modeling of alloys under high-energy particle irradiation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Grain boundary stiffness and mobility determine the kinetics of curvature-driven grain growth. Here the stiffness and mobility are computed using an analysis of fluctuations in the grain boundary position during molecular dynamics simulations. This work represents the first determination of grain boundary stiffness for a realistic three-dimensional system. The results indicate that the boundary stiffness for a given boundary plane has a strong dependence on the direction of the boundary distortion. The mobility deduced is comparable with that determined in previous computer simulation studies. The advantages and limitations of the fluctuation approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {A new ADP potential for the Au-Rh system was developed by fitting to a database of experimental and first principle data, and the validity of the potential was tested. Then, the element segregation of Au-Rh nanoparticles was studied by Monte Carlo simulation using this potential. The results show that the preferential segregation behavior of atoms in Au-Rh nanoparticles is not affected by the particle size. On the surface, due to the large surface energy difference between Au and Rh, the element segregation is mainly induced by the surface energy, and Au atoms preferentially occupy the lower coordination sites. In the body, Au atoms tend to occupy the sites with small local pressure to release strain energy, while the whole system tends to reduce the interface area to decrease the interface energy. The element segregation is primarily induced by the strain energy, and the interface energy also participates in the competition. The final structure is the result of the competition between strain energy and interface energy.},

@article{OpenKIM-MO:961101070310:000a,
	abstract = {Local stress relaxation mechanisms of crystals are a long-standing interest in the field of materials physics. Constantly encountered inelastic deformation mechanisms in metals under dynamic loadings, such as dislocation, deformation twinning and phase transition, have been extensively discussed separately or as some of their combinations. Recently, virtual melting is found to be a dominant local stress relaxation mechanism under extreme strain rates. However, these deformation mechanisms have never been investigated in the same metal at an atomic level due to the lack of high pressure interatomic potentials. In this work, an embedded-atom model potential of Pb is developed and tested for high pressure applications. The developed potential of Pb could not only reproduce many energetic, elastic and defective properties at ambient conditions well, but also correctly describe face-centered cubic (fcc)-hexagonal close packed (hcp) and hcp-body-centered cubic phase transition of Pb under high pressures. Shock Hugoniot, as well as equation of states for fcc and hcp phase, also agrees well with the literature ones up to more than 100 GPa. With the developed potential, non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations are conducted to investigate dynamic behaviors of Pb single crystal under ramp-shock compressions. Depending on applied strain rates, dislocation-mediated plasticity, phase transition and virtual melting, constantly reported by experiments or theoretical investigations, are observed in our results. Additionally, a new phase transition mechanism of Pb subjected to the ramp compressions is uncovered.},
